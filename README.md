Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The CMCS features a clean, user-friendly web interface designed to make claim submissions and approvals simple and intuitive.
Lecturers can log in, submit their monthly claim by entering hours and rates, upload supporting documents, and track the status of their claim in real time.
Programme Coordinators can review claims, check uploaded documents, and either approve or request changes.
Academic Managers have a dedicated dashboard to view pending claims and give final approval.

The design focuses on clarity and ease of use, with a responsive layout that works across devices, ensuring lecturers and administrators can manage claims efficiently without unnecessary complexity.
